<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">SD Card Repair: How to Fix Corrupted SD Card</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">Common Signs Indicating SD Card Corruption/Damage</span></h2>
<p>Signs of SD card corruption/damage:</p>
<ul class="ul_content">
    <li>No SD card detected: You insert your SD card into your digital camera or laptop, wait, wait some more, but nothing happens. No sound, no message, nothing. An experience like this can be alarming, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that your SD card is dead. In the next section of this article, we explain how to fix an&nbsp;SD card that&rsquo;s no longer detected.</li>
    <li>Read/write issues: When transferring data to/from an SD card, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any error messages indicating read/write issues, and you definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have to attempt to transfer the same file multiple times just for the transfer to finish successfully. Every read/write issue you encounter should be a major reason for concern.</li>
    <li>Connection issues: If you have to reinsert the SD card several times before it finally mounts properly, you might be dealing with SD card corruption or even physical damage. SD cards are notoriously fragile, and it doesn&rsquo;t take much for them to crack, bend, or twist. When that happens, the small metal pins may come out of alignment and cause connection issues.</li>
    <li>Windows format error: When you see the dreaded Windows format error (You need to format the disk in drive X: before you can use it), you know there&rsquo;s something wrong with your SD card. If the SD card is empty, you can simply format it, and it should work again. But if it contains important data, you need to fix it using one of the methods described below.</li>
    <li>Slow performance: Corruption or damage can negatively impact the performance of your SD card and make data transfers take a very long time. In extreme cases, it might take you as much as several hours to transfer just a few photos or video files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">Ways to Fix Corrupted or Damaged SD Card</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">1. Try Another USB Port or Change the Adapter or Card Reader</span></h2>
<p>This is by far the easiest fix you can try,&nbsp;which is why you should always start with it before you move on to other ways to fix a corrupted/damaged SD card.</p>
<p>If you have a laptop with a built-in SD card reader, we recommend you purchase a USB card reader and try several different USB ports, preferably on more than one computer.</p>
<p>You should also rule out that your microSD card to SD card adapter is to blame by using a different adapter or connecting the&nbsp;microSD card&nbsp;directly to your computer via a microSD card reader.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">2. Fix a Card by Trying CHKDSK Command to Check for Memory Card Errors</span></h2>
<p>Included in all versions of Windows is a command-line utility for checking the file system and file system metadata of a volume for logical and physical errors.&nbsp;This utility is called CHKDSK, and it&rsquo;s actually much easier to use than most people think.</p>
<p>To fix a corrupted SD card using the CHKDSK command:</p>
<p>Enter the following command (make sure to replace X with the letter assigned to the SD card you want to fix) and press Enter:&nbsp;chkdsk X: /f&nbsp;(The /f parameter tells CHKDSK to fix all memory card errors.)</p>
<p>Enter the following command (make sure to replace X with the letter assigned to the SD card you want to fix) and press Enter:&nbsp;chkdsk X: /f&nbsp;(The /f parameter tells CHKDSK to fix all memory card errors.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">3. Use SD Card Data Recovery Software to Recover Files</span></h2>
<p>SD card corruption and damage may result in the loss of important files. To get them back, you can use&nbsp;SD card data recovery software&nbsp;like Disk Drill.</p>
<p>Disk Drill is a reliable&nbsp;data recovery solution&nbsp;with&nbsp;support for all types of SD cards, including SD, SD High Capacity (SDHC), and SD Extended Capacity (SDXC). It can quickly recover any files (pictures, videos, audio, documents, etc.), and you can preview recoverable files before recovery.</p>
<p>The free version of Disk Drill lets you recover up to 500 MB, and it comes with several handy data protection and backup features, which you can use to protect your SD card against future data loss.</p>
<p>To recover files from an SD card using data recovery software:</p>
<ol class="ol_content">
    <li>Download&nbsp;and install Disk Drill.</li>
    <li>Connect the SD card to your computer and launch Disk Drill.</li>
    <li>Select the SD card and click&nbsp;Search for lost data.</li>
    <li>Check the files you want to recover.</li>
    <li>Click the&nbsp;Recover&nbsp;button at the bottom</li>
    <li>Check the files you want to recover.</li>
    <li>Click the&nbsp;Recover&nbsp;button at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Specify the recovery destination and click&nbsp;OK&nbsp;to begin the recovery of your files.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">4. Try to Use SD Card on Another Device/PC</span></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that your SD card is perfectly fine and that all the issues you&rsquo;re experiencing with it are caused by your computer. To rule out this possibility, you should&nbsp;try to use the card on another computer or device.</p>
<p>You can ask your friend to let you use his/her computer, or you can visit a public library and use one of their computers to verify that the issues you&rsquo;re experiencing happen on every device.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to diagnose a microSD card and have a smartphone with a microSD card slot, you can use it as a convenient test device and verify your card&rsquo;s functionality without a computer. Just be careful because&nbsp;your smartphone might ask you if you want to format the SD card, so make sure you don&rsquo;t accidentally erase it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">5. Assign a New Drive Letter</span></h2>
<p>Surprisingly many SD card errors can be solved by&nbsp;assigning a new drive letter to the SD card. The errors solved by this method typically have something to do with conflicting drive letters, which may happen as a result of the operating system not updating drive letter information properly.</p>
<p>To assign a new drive letter to an SD card:</p>
<p>Type &ldquo;disk management&rdquo; in the search box on the taskbar and select&nbsp;Create and format hard disk partitions.</p>
<p>Right-click on your SD card and select the&nbsp;Change Drive Letter and Paths&hellip;&nbsp;option.</p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Change&hellip;&nbsp;button</p>
<p>Select a new drive letter and click&nbsp;OK</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;OK&nbsp;again to close the Change Drive Letter and Paths window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #36439A;">6. Reinstall SD Card Drivers</span></h2>
<p>Windows automatically downloads and installs the most recent drivers through Windows Update, but not all driver updates go exactly according to plan. If you suspect that your SD card is misbehaving because of a faulty driver update, you should reinstall it manually.</p>
<p>To reinstall card drivers:</p>
<p>Type &ldquo;device manager&rdquo; in the search on the taskbar and select&nbsp;Device Manager.</p>
<ol class="ol_content">
    <li>Go through the available categories and look for your SD card (we found it located under&nbsp;Portable Devices).</li>
    <li>Right-click the SD card and select&nbsp;Update driver.</li>
    <li>Select&nbsp;Search automatically for updated driver software.</li>
    <li>Select&nbsp;Update Driver.</li>
</ol>
